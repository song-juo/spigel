**Fast** node library which implements many hashing algorithms and media manipulation bindings into a *friendly API* which **discards the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence)** for image semelliance level classsification trough the use of pure math.

### Give it a try 🌸

```bash
npm i tamayo
```

### 🖼️ It's simple as:

```js
import { compare } from  'tamayo';

async  function  someFunction() {
const  result = await  compare(string  or  buffer, string  or  buffer);
// => Outputs the difference between the input, and it's correspondent hashes.
}
```
